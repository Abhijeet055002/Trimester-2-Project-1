# Trimester-2-Project-1
Analyzed import-export data using unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means and hierarchical clustering to uncover trade patterns, segments, and anomalies.

# Import-Export Data Analysis Using Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing import-export trade data using unsupervised learning techniques to uncover patterns, segments, and anomalies in the dataset. The analysis provides valuable insights into market trends, product groupings, and trade behaviors.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and transformation of raw data for analysis.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Implementation of K-Means and hierarchical clustering to identify distinct groups within the data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilized silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Visualization**: Generated cluster boundary plots and dendrograms to illustrate the clustering results.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identified two primary clusters with strategic implications for trade optimization.

## Files Included
1. **Project Notebook (Jupyter)**:
   - Contains the complete Python code for data preprocessing, clustering, evaluation, and visualization.
2. **Cluster Boundary Visualization**:
   - Graphical representation of K-Means clustering results.
3. **Dendrogram Visualization**:
   - Hierarchical clustering results showing relationships between data points.
4. **Silhouette Analysis**:
   - Graph indicating the optimal number of clusters based on silhouette scores.
5. **Managerial Insights**:
   - Detailed findings and recommendations derived from the analysis.

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file to view the code and run analyses.
2. Refer to visualizations to interpret the clustering results.
3. Use managerial insights for actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
